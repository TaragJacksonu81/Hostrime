### Advanced Tools for Better Conversion

#### **Leadboxes**

One standout feature of Leadpages is **LeadBoxes**—customizable pop-ups that can appear on blogs, websites, or other digital assets. These pop-ups can be triggered by a button click, text, or even images, providing an excellent opportunity to capture leads in a targeted way. LeadBoxes can also be set up with timers to display after a specific duration, maximizing engagement.

Another powerful feature is the **Exit LeadBox**, which appears when a visitor is about to leave your website. This functionality enables you to present a last-minute offer or valuable content, increasing the chances of retaining potential leads.

#### **Native Ad Creation**

With Leadpages, you can create Facebook and Instagram ads directly from the platform. This feature saves time and maximizes ad spend by pulling content from your landing pages to automatically craft engaging advertisements. Users can review, tweak, and publish ads seamlessly, driving targeted traffic to their landing pages. Additionally, Leadpages integrates with the Facebook Pixel for advanced analytics and retargeting capabilities.

#### **A/B Split Testing**

Testing is crucial for any successful digital marketing strategy. Leadpages includes a built-in split testing feature, allowing users to compare different landing page designs side by side.
